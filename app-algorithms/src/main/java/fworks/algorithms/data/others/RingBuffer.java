/**
 * Ring buffer.<br/>
 * Based on: A ring buffer, or circular queue, is a FIFO data structure of a fixed size N. It is
 * useful for transferring data between asynchronous processes or for storing log files. When the
 * buffer is empty, the consumer waits until data is deposited; when the buffer is full, the
 * producer waits to deposit data. Develop an API for a RingBuffer and an implementation that uses
 * an array representation (with circular wrap-around).
